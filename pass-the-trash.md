# Pass The Trash

## Dealing
- Every player is dealt 7 cards face down

## The Rules
- Players will engage in 3 rounds of trading to begin
    - The first round, players trade 3 cards
    - The second round, players trade 2 cards
    - The third round, players trade 1 card
    - The trades should be made in such a pattern to minimize a player immediately getting their own card returned (e.g. you should not have players send cards to the player to their right and then immediately to the player to their left)
    - There is betting between each round
- Players pick their highest or lowest 5 card hand and discard the remaining two cards
- Players all flip up their cards, one at a time, with a round of betting between each flip
- Low and high hands split the pot
