# Screw Your Neighbor

## Dealing
- Everyone is dealt 1 card face down
- In betwen each round, the person who is dealt the first card rotates

## The Rules
- Each person has three stacks of chips in front of them (the denomination of each does not matter, only that each person has the same total amount)
- The person first dealt to "leads" (takes their turn first)
- On each player's turn, they can decide to trade their card with the player to their left (unless they are the last player)
    - The last player will trade with the top of the deck
    - The player to their left must trade unless:
        - That player has a King (but they must reveal it)
        or
        - The card to be traded has already been traded 3 times
        - These same exceptions apply to the top of the deck
- After each player has traded or kept their card, all players reveal their cards
- The player with the lowest card puts one of their stacks into the pot
- The last player standing gets the pot
