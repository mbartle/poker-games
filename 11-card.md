# 11 Card

## Dealing
- Everyone is dealt 11 cards, face down
- No one looks at their cards

## The Rules
- The rules are essentially the same as [10 Card](10-card.md), with a slight twist
- Players have 11 cards, and are trying to still make two 5-card hands
    - So, at any time, when a player flips over a card, they can use it to replace one of the cards in either of their hands (but they can only do this once)
    - 9s can now act as a placeholder
