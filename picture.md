# Picture

## Dealing
- Everyone is dealt 5 cards face down

## The Rules
- Played like 5 Card Draw with 2-3 rounds of trading and betting
- Before any round of trading, a player can take a picture of their hand before trading part of it away
- After all trading and betting, players will have two hands: the hand in their picture and the hand they are left with at the end
- Between all players' two hands, the high and low hands split the pot (could all be taken by one player)
