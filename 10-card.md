# 10 Card

## Dealing
- Everyone is dealt 10 cards, face down
- No one looks at their cards

## The Rules
- Players take turns flipping over a card from their hand
    - They flip the card over and upon seeing it place it into one of two face-up hands on the table
    - Once a card is in a certain hand, the card cannot move to the other hand
- The highest hand and lowest hand split the pot, so players are trying to form a high hand and a low hand
- No one bets until the first player flips over their third card
    - Once that player flips the third card, only the flipping player can bet until all players have seven cards face up
