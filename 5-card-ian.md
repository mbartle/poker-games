# 5 Card Ian

## Dealing
- Everyone is dealt 5 cards face down

## The Rules
- There is one round of betting after the cards are dealt
    - Because there is only one round of betting, the ante and the minimum bet might be larger than other games
- High and low hand split the pot
- That's it. That's all the rules. It's a great game.
