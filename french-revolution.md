# French Revolution

## Dealing
- It's 5 Card Draw.

## The Rules
- Played like 5 Card Draw with 1-2 rounds of trading and betting.
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are all wild, unless your neighbor (either the player on your left or the player on your right) has a Jack.
    - Your own Jacks do not invalidate your face cards, just your neighbor's.
- Recommend fewer exchanges with fewer players. Everyone getting a Jack is an anticlimax.
